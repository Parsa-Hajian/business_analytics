    "### 2.6 Preparation for Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goal:\n",
    "Before training any model, it's crucial to prepare the data to ensure it is aligned with the campaign’s strategic objectives. This stage connects the data, variables, and decisions to the goals of the marketing campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data as a Strategic Asset:\n",
    "The first step is to recognize that **data is not just raw input** but a **representation of business operations and customer behavior**. The quality of the data limits the potential of the analytics. The data must include various dimensions that provide insight into customer behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Customer Characteristics**: Demographic details (age, job, education), financial attributes (loan status, default), and behavioral indicators (e.g., past purchase behavior).\n",
    "2. **Campaign Interaction Data**: Includes variables such as number of contacts, communication channel used, month and day of contact, and previous campaign outcomes.\n",
    "3. **Historical Engagement**: Data that shows past interactions, such as whether the customer has been contacted before or if they’ve subscribed in the past.\n",
    "4. **Contextual and Economic Conditions**: Variables like employment variation, consumer confidence, interest rates, and other factors affecting customer behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature Engineering and Strategic Design:\n",
    "**Feature Engineering** is more than just a technical task; it is **strategic**. Each new feature or transformation represents a hypothesis about customer behavior. The features you create should be connected to the campaign’s goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- In the **bank marketing example**, creating the `previous_contact` feature (indicating whether a client had been contacted before) is a **strategic decision** that provides insight into how a customer might respond to future contacts.\n",
    "- Similarly, **grouping job categories** or **creating age ranges** are strategic decisions that affect the model's performance and interpretability."
