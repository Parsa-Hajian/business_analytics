    "\n",
    "#### Goal:\n",
    "The **Conversion Rate (CR)** measures how efficiently the campaign turns contacts into customers. It is the percentage of contacted clients who ultimately subscribe to the term deposit.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "- The **Conversion Rate (CR)** is a direct indicator of how well the marketing campaign performs in terms of customer response. A higher CR means that the campaign is successfully targeting customers who are more likely to convert.\n",
